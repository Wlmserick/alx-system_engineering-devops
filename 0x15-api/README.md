# Important Concepts in Software Development

## What Bash Scripting Should Not Be Used For

Bash scripting is powerful for automating tasks in a Unix-like environment, but it's not suitable for complex software development or tasks requiring extensive processing or data manipulation. For such cases, higher-level languages like Python or JavaScript are more appropriate.

## What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

## What is a REST API?

A REST (Representational State Transfer) API is a type of API that follows the principles of REST architecture. It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. REST APIs are widely used for web services and web development.

## What are Microservices?

Microservices is an architectural style where a complex application is composed of small, independent services that are loosely coupled and communicate with each other via APIs. Each microservice is responsible for a specific function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## What is the CSV Format?

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a plain-text format for storing tabular data, where each line represents a row and fields are separated by commas. It's commonly used for importing/exporting data between different software applications, especially in spreadsheet programs.

## What is the JSON Format?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It consists of key-value pairs and arrays, making it suitable for representing structured data.

## Pythonic Naming Conventions

- **Package and Module Name Style**: Lowercase with underscores (`snake_case`).
- **Class Name Style**: CapWords or CamelCase (`PascalCase`).
- **Variable Name Style**: Lowercase with underscores (`snake_case`).
- **Function Name Style**: Lowercase with underscores (`snake_case`).
- **Constant Name Style**: Uppercase with underscores (`UPPER_CASE`).
