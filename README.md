* `find`: Finds files that match a certain criteria. For example, the following command will find all files in the current directory that end in the .txt extension:

```
find . -name "*.txt"
```

* `ln`: Creates a symbolic link to a file or directory. A symbolic link is a file that points to another file or directory. For example, the following command will create a symbolic link called `my_link` that points to the file `my_file.txt`:

```
ln -s my_file.txt my_link
```

* `head`: Prints the first few lines of a file. For example, the following command will print the first 10 lines of the file `my_file.txt`:

```
head -n 10 my_file.txt
```

* `tail`: Prints the last few lines of a file. For example, the following command will print the last 10 lines of the file `my_file.txt`:

```
tail -n 10 my_file.txt
```

* `diff`: Compares two files or directories. For example, the following command will compare the files `my_file.txt` and `my_copy.txt`:

```
diff my_file.txt my_copy.txt
```

* `sed`: Edits text files. Sed is a powerful tool that can be used to perform a variety of text editing operations. For example, the following command will replace all occurrences of the word "text" with the word "string" in the file `my_file.txt`:

```
sed 's/text/string/g' my_file.txt
```

* `awk`: Processes text files. Awk is another powerful tool that can be used to perform a variety of text processing operations. For example, the following command will print the line numbers and contents of all lines in the file `my_file.txt` that contain the word "text":

```
awk '{print $1, $2}' my_file.txt | grep "text"
```

* `tr`: Translates characters. Tr is a simple tool that can be used to translate characters from one set to another. For example, the following command will replace all spaces with tabs in the file `my_file.txt`:

```
tr -s ' ' '\t' my_file.txt
```

* `tee`: Copies output to multiple files or standard output. Tee is a useful tool that can be used to save the output of a command to multiple files or to standard output. For example, the following command will print the contents of the file `my_file.txt` to the terminal and to the file `my_output.txt`:

```
tee my_output.txt cat my_file.txt
```

* `xargs`: Executes a command with the arguments provided as input. Xargs is a useful tool that can be used to pipe the output of one command to the input of another command. For example, the following command will sort the lines in the file `my_file.txt` and then print the sorted lines to the terminal:

```
sort < my_file.txt | xargs ca
